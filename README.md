# Youth Smoking and Drug Analysis ML Insights


**Overview:** üåü

This project investigates the patterns and trends of smoking and drug use among youth, analyzing various demographic and behavioral factors that contribute to substance use. The analysis utilizes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand key risk factors, including age, gender, social environment, and family background. Additionally, machine learning models are employed to predict the likelihood of youth engaging in smoking or drug use, providing valuable insights for prevention strategies. The aim of this project is to support efforts in reducing substance abuse through data-driven insights and predictive modeling.


**Key Features:** üîë

1. Data Exploration: In-depth analysis of youth smoking and drug use behavior based on demographic factors, such as age, gender, and socioeconomic status.
2. Risk Factor Identification: Identifying key influencers such as peer pressure, family habits, and environmental factors contributing to substance use among young people.
3. Predictive Modeling: Using machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of smoking and drug use based on the identified factors, helping in targeted interventions.
4. Correlation Analysis: Understanding the relationships between different factors like age, family background, and substance use to uncover key trends.
5. Visualization: Effective use of bar charts, histograms, heatmaps, and scatter plots to illustrate data patterns and highlight critical findings.
6. Prevention Insights: Providing actionable recommendations to help policymakers and health organizations design targeted prevention programs based on the results.

**Key Insights:** üìà

1. Age and Risk Factors: Adolescents aged 15-18 show the highest likelihood of substance use, especially in environments where smoking or drug use is normalized.
2. Gender Differences: Males are more likely to engage in smoking and drug use compared to females, though the gap narrows with certain substances.
3. Peer Influence: Youth surrounded by peers who smoke or use drugs are significantly more likely to adopt these behaviors themselves.
4. Family Environment: Family history of smoking or drug use plays a major role in predicting youth substance habits.
5. Predictive Models: Machine learning models, including Random Forest and Logistic Regression, accurately predict substance use behavior with high accuracy, aiding in early intervention.
